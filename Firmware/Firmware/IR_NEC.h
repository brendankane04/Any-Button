 *
 * This project uses Timer/Counter and External interrupt to decode IR NEC protocol.
 *
 * Hardware support:
 * ATtiny85: 8-bit Timer/Counter0, INT0
 * ATtiny88: 8-bit Timer/Counter0, INT0
 * CPU clock is 8 MHz.
 *
 * In file IR_NEC.c you can modify pulse durations according to your measurements (e.g. by oscilloscope)
 * and pulse thresholds (min. and max. durations for each pulse)
 * using pulse tolerance multiplier (use in interval from 1 to 2; the greater the multiplier, the greater the tolerance).
 *
 * Connect output pin of IR receiver to input pin PB2->ATtiny85 / PD2->ATtiny88 (pin 7/4).
 *
 * Execute IR_init(uint32_t bufferTimeout) function to initialize IR receiving and set buffer timeout.
 * When timeout occurs, IR data won't be accessible. Before timeout the last received IR data are stored.
 * Set buffer timeout according to delay which is caused by main program. For zero delay write IR_init(0).
 * Actually buffer timeout has some min. value which is necessary, because of time between individual IR codes.
 *
 * Repetition for certain commands can be disabled using IR_disable_repetition(uint8_t command).
 * For each command one IR_disable_repetition(uint8_t command) execution is needed.
 * So while holding a button, your instructions related to the command are executed just once (IR_data_ready() returns false).
 * Disabled repetition can be enabled using IR_enable_repetition(uint8_t command) again.
 *
 * Then just check IR_data_ready() function in loop.
 * If IR_data_ready() returns true, IR signal has been checked succesfully and then IR data (address and command) are available.
 * Access to IR data is through IR_data structure named IR (IR.address for address, IR.command for command).
 *
 * Make sure to execute sei() function to enable global interrupts.
